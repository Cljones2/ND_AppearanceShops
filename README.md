When you install this you will have to go to your database inside nd characters and clean out the metadata 

after you done this 

when you load into game 
if the player appearance dosnt load 

do /skin 1 in your chat 

then change your appearance 

save that 

go to a outfits store and add an outfit 

save that 

quit out of game 

do not /changecharacter 

then hopefully if all gose well your player will load up with your previous appearance ðŸ˜‰
